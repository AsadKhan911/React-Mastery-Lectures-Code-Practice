Redux is a state management library for JavaScript applications, often used with React. It helps manage the state of your application in a more predictable way.

Here's an easy way to understand it:

Imagine your app is a big warehouse. Inside this warehouse, you have many items (pieces of data) that different parts of your app need to access and update. Without a system, it can get chaotic with different parts of your app trying to update data in their own way.

Redux acts like a well-organized storage system for this warehouse:

Store: This is the central place where all your app's data (state) is kept.

Actions: These are like requests to the warehouse, asking it to change the state in some way (e.g., add an item, update an item).

Reducers: These are the rules that tell the warehouse how to handle each action and what changes to make to the state.

By using Redux, you ensure that your app's state is managed consistently, making it easier to debug, test, and understand.
