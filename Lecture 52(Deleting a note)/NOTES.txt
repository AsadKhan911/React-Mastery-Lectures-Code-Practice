First of all we write the logic for delete note in noteState file which is a context file:

 //Delete a note
      const deleteNote = (id) =>{
      const  newNotes = notes.filter((note)=>{return note._id!==id}) //it will make a seperate array of notes excluding the id matched with deleted note
        setNotes(newNotes)
      }

This will take one parameter as id and filter the notes which satisfy the condition that parameter id !== note._id means all notes id.

Noteitem.js:

<i className="fa-solid fa-trash mx-1" onClick={()=>{deleteNote(note._id)}}></i>

This is noteItem file in this file we use context of deleteNote function from noteState and give it a parameter note._id , means it will pass this parameter to contextFunction whose parameter is 'id' and the filter method will filter all the notes and exclude it.
