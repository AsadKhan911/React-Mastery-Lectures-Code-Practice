useLocation is a hook provided by react-router-dom that gives you access to the location object, which represents the current URL in your web application.

Key Properties of the Location Object
pathname: The path of the URL (e.g., /about).

search: The query string of the URL (e.g., ?name=Asad).

hash: The hash fragment of the URL (e.g., #section1).

state: Any state that was passed with the navigation (e.g., when using history.push with state).

When to Use useLocation
Accessing the current URL: When you need to read information from the URL, such as the pathname or query parameters.

Conditional rendering: When you want to render different components or elements based on the current URL. //we worked on this thing.

Handling navigation state: When you need to access custom state passed through navigation.

CODE WE DID:(In navbar comp)

import { useLocation } from 'react-router-dom';
const Navbar = () => {

  let location = useLocation(); 

  <Link className={`nav-link ${location.pathname === '/home' ? 'active': ""}`} aria-current="page" to="/home">Home</Link>
  <Link className={`nav-link ${location.pathname==='/about' ? "active" : ""}`} aria-current="page" to="/about">About</Link>

This line of code means whenever the pathname of location is /home or /about to unko active class dedo , active class is used to prominent the keywords like wo highlight hojaty hein bootstrap ki class h. In short useLocation hook ka use yehi hota h k ham current url location find krsken.
