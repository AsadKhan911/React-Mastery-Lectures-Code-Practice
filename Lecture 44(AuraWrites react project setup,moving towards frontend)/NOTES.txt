In this lecture we are transferring to front end side:

First of all we install two packages:

1). npm i react-router-dom: For setting the react router we already learned previously.
2). npm i concurrently: It help us to run backend(nodemon) and frontend(react app) at the same time in same terminal so that we can easily run both and see results.

-> After that we put this thing in our create-react-app packet.json file script section ("both": "concurrently \"npm run start\" \"nodemon backend/index.js\"")

-> Now we can use command npm run both and both servers will start.
