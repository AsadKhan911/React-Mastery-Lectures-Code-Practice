In this lecture me make a redux store, Steps we follow:

1). First we make a file index.js in state folder and write this code

export * as actionCreators from './action-creators/index'

2). Secondly we make a file store.js in state folder and write this code

import { applyMiddleware, createStore } from "redux";
import { thunk } from "redux-thunk"; // Correct import
import reducers from "./reducers";

export const store = createStore(reducers, {}, applyMiddleware(thunk));

3). We wrap <Provider></Provider> in main index.js file of the react-app setup

import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';
import './index.css';
import App from './App';
import reportWebVitals from './reportWebVitals';
import {Provider} from 'react-redux';
import { store } from './state/store';

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <Provider store={store}>
    <App />
    </Provider>
  </React.StrictMode>
);

reportWebVitals();

By Doing this all of our application has the access to the redux store.

4). Lastly we make a file index.js in the reducers folder and write this code:

import {combineReducers} from 'redux';
import amountReducer from './amountReducer';

const reducers = combineReducers({
    amount: amountReducer
})

export default reducers;

This will combine all of the reducers which we have made in reducers folder.
